# TechWithWarriors Internship - Machine Learning Tasks

This repository contains five machine learning tasks completed during my internship with **TechWithWarriors**. Each task explores different machine learning techniques and datasets using popular libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Linear Regression for House Price Prediction
- Dataset: California Housing Dataset
- Goal: Predict house prices using a linear regression model.
- Tools: Scikit-learn

### Task 2: Decision Tree Classifier for Iris Flower Classification
- Dataset: Iris Dataset
- Goal: Classify iris flowers based on features using a decision tree classifier.
- Tools: Scikit-learn

### Task 3: K-Nearest Neighbors for MNIST Image Classification
- Dataset: MNIST Dataset
- Goal: Implement a KNN classifier for image classification.
- Tools: TensorFlow, Keras

### Task 4: Movie Recommendation System Using Collaborative Filtering
- Dataset: MovieLens Dataset
- Goal: Build a recommendation system using collaborative filtering.
- Tools: Pandas, Scikit-learn

### Task 5: Deep Learning for Object Detection
- Dataset: COCO Dataset
- Goal: Train and fine-tune an object detection model.
- Tools: PyTorch

## Repository Structure
- Each task is located in its respective folder (`task1`, `task2`, etc.).
- Each folder contains a detailed Jupyter notebook explaining the task and code.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x


## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
